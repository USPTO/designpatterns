            <h4>When to use</h4>
            <p>The purpose of personas is to provide a reliable representation of your key audience segments for reference.  The included questions and areas of discussion will help you construct a “picture” of the visitors to your site.​</p>
            <h4>Benefits</h4>
            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <h4>Tips</h4>
            <p>For any given project, it is advisable to limit yourself to the main audiences for the site, and only 3 or 4 of them at best. The more personas you have the more granular the population you are working toward supporting.  It is better to paint with a broad brush and meet the needs of the larger populations than try to meet the needs of everyone.
