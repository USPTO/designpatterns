###Tips
For any given project, it is advisable to limit yourself to the main audiences for the site, and only 3 or 4 of them at best. The more personas you have the more granular the population you are working toward supporting.  It is better to paint with a broad brush and meet the needs of the larger populations than try to meet the needs of everyone.
